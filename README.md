# Melissa's Portfolio
This website is a portfolio of all of my current projects.  It was orginally designed as a project for my coding class work, but excited to share it as an example of my work so far!

The template I used is from a HTML5 UP, which is free for personal use, learn more at html5up.net.  I modified some styles elements to fit my style.
